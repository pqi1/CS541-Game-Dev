Game Dev works
This is a simple android app that let me learn about the basic operations about Android Studio. 
When you first open the app you can see an Input box, a message box, and two pigs at the bottom. When you enter somthing into the Input box and press the botton. The input word will show up at the message box with a different color shadow. Also, the direction of the pig face will change.
